# pset7

This repository contains my solutions to problem set 7 of Harvard's second introductory computer science course. Code I wrote summarized below.

What I implemented:

* all methods within Flower.ml, Hive.ml, Bee.ml, Cave.ml, Bear.ml, Pasture.ml, Cow.ml, BeeBouncy.ml, BeeRandom.ml
* methods and inheritance relationships of Movable.ml, Ageable.ml, Dust.ml, CarbonBased.ml
* altered generate functions within Main.ml

Installation:
latest version of OCaml: http://ocaml.org/docs/install.html

Run Instructions:
compile with ```make```
launch world simulation with ```./Main.byte part6```

Note: simulation can be sped up by pressing f and slowed by pressing s.
