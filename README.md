# pset7

This repository contains my solutions to problem set 7 of Harvard's second introductory computer science course. Code I wrote summarized below; for more details, see problem set specification (pset7.pdf).

What I implemented:

* all methods within Flower.ml, Hive.ml, Bee.ml, Cave.ml, Bear.ml, Pasture.ml, Cow.ml, BeeBouncy.ml, BeeRandom.ml
* methods and inheritance relationships of Movable.ml, Ageable.ml, Dust.ml, CarbonBased.ml
* altered generate functions within Main.ml
